#     1)Librarian
#     2)Administrator
#     3)Borrower

#     LIB1:
#         1)Enter Branch you manage
#         2)Quite to previous (should take you menu MAIN)
#         <take input>
        
#         For Option 1, Give a list of Library branches using the names or locations like this:
#             LIB2:
#                 1)University Library, Boston 
#                 2)State Library, New York

#                 The user will only pick the number in the above list and you should figure out 
#                 which branch he is referring. Based on the selection, the next list would be:
#                     LIB3:
